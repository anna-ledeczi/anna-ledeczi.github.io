I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate working with Harold Tobin in the Fault Structure, Stress, & Tectonics group at the University of Washington. 

I am interested in accretionary wedges at subduction zones—specifically, their evolution, faulting, and ability to host coseismic slip—and the resulting hazards to coastal communities. I bridge using geophysical methods like marine active-source seismology and field-based approaches like geological mapping, to investigate these issues from a variety of timescales, spatial scales, and perspectives.
