### Seismica Diamond Open Access Journal

I am passionate about community-facing research that has usable products and tangible outcomes with public benefit. I work to make my research and others’ open access by publishing in and volunteering as a copyeditor for diamond open access journal [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/index). I typeset accepted articles using LaTeX and Python to prepare them for publication. 

### GSA Structural Geology & Tectonics Division Board Student Representative

I am the student representative for the GSA Structural Geology & Tectonics Division, where I work to promote student interests in the division. 

### Pacific Northwest Seismic Network

From 2022 to 2024, I volunteered as a duty seismologist for the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network [Pacific Northwest Seismic Network](pnsn.org) to assist with earthquake response. As a duty seismologist, I was responsible for responding to alert earthquakes M>2.95 for one week periods every couple months. 

### Rockin' Out

I served a two-year term as graduate student coordinator of [Rockin' Out](https://rockinoutuw.wixsite.com/home), a K-12 outreach group that has been housed in the Department of Earth & Space Sciences at the University of Washington for  15 years. We target underserved K-12 communities in Seattle and around Washington state with geoscience curriculum. We focus particularly on developing a place-based curriculum on local natural hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanos, to help students learn about their local environment. We work to emphasize potential careers for geoscience majors to combat negative perceptions of the field.
