My Ph.D. focuses on the architecture and evolution of the **Cascadia subduction zone accretionary wedge**, including the megathrust fault and splay faults branching from it, and their connection to **megathrust earthquakes**. I work with Harold Tobin in the Fault Structure, Stress, & Tectonics group at the University of Washington, where I combine **marine active-source seismology** offshore and **field geology onshore** to understand how seismogenic zone processes operate in the modern Cascadia subduction zone.

**The landward vergence zone, offshore Washington and Oregon**

• In Chapter 1 of my Ph.D., I used **seismic reflection data to map active and inactive splay faulting** in the outer wedge off Washington and northern Oregon and consider the evidence for coseismic slip on these faults. I paired high-resolution sparker with crustal-scale multi-channel seismic reflection data to identify the faults that exhibit evidence of activity in the very late Quaternary—and in some cases Holocene—but also link to the megathrust at depth, thus having the potential to slip during megathrust events. My findings in [Ledeczi et al. (2024)] (https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1158) support the hypothesis that many splay faults are potential candidates for hosting coseismic slip, and that **Cascadia will likely experience distributed shallow rupture on multiple splay faults** located within ~30 km of the deformation front **in a future megathrust event**. 

• In my subsequent work, I am using the active and inactive splay faults I identified to inform **structural modeling** of seismic reflection data to better understand the **sequence of fault activation** during the evolution of the accretionary wedge. Since Cascadia is a clastic sediment rich subduction zone, we want to understand the influence of high sedimentation rates offshore Washington on suppressing active faulting in the inner wedge.

What geologic fault zone processes and wall rock characteristics allow Cascadia to host giant megathrust earthquakes? What brittle and ductile deformation processes occur deep within the clastic sedimentation dominated accretionary wedge during subduction to seismogenic zone conditions and exhumation?
• In Chapter 2, I document the macrostructural characteristics, microstructural deformation mechanisms, and potential coseismic indicators in action at the subduction interface recorded in an exhumed paleomegathrust shear zone in the Olympic Mountains.
• In Chapter 3, I quantify the interseismic volume strain via pressure solution across a mélange zone with varying deformation levels.
