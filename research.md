My Ph.D. focuses on the architecture and evolution of the **Cascadia subduction zone accretionary wedge**, including the megathrust fault and splay faults branching from it, and their connection to **megathrust earthquakes**. I work with Harold Tobin in the Fault Structure, Stress, & Tectonics group at the University of Washington, where I combine **marine active-source seismology** offshore and **field geology** onshore to understand how seismogenic zone processes operate in the modern Cascadia subduction zone.

**The landward vergence zone, offshore Washington and Oregon:**

- In Chapter 1 of my Ph.D., I used **seismic reflection data to map active and inactive splay faulting** in the outer wedge off Washington and northern Oregon and consider the evidence for coseismic slip on these faults. I paired high-resolution sparker with crustal-scale multi-channel seismic reflection data to identify the faults that exhibit evidence of activity in the very late Quaternary—and in some cases Holocene—but also link to the megathrust at depth, thus having the potential to slip during megathrust events. My findings in
[Ledeczi et al. (2024)](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1158) support the hypothesis that many splay faults are potential candidates for hosting coseismic slip, and that **Cascadia will likely experience distributed shallow rupture on multiple splay faults** located within ~30 km of the deformation front **in a future megathrust event**. 

- In my subsequent work, I am using the active and inactive splay faults I identified to inform **structural modeling** of seismic reflection data to better understand the **sequence of fault activation** during the evolution of the accretionary wedge. Since Cascadia is a clastic sediment rich subduction zone, we want to understand the influence of high sedimentation rates offshore Washington on suppressing active faulting in the inner wedge.

**The Olympic Subduction Complex, Olympic National Park:**

While geophysical tools have allowed us to probe active accretionary wedges, direct evidence of the conditions that promote coseismic slip can only be found by examining the plate boundary itself, such as through exhumed subduction terranes. In this work, I **document a previously undescribed exhumed seismogenic paleomegathrust interface in the Olympic Mountains, WA**—the first such example from the modern Cascadia subduction zone. Until this work, no geological investigations have been conducted west of Mt. Olympus since the 1970s.

- At Lake of the Gods, we characterize a previously undescribed pervasively sheared high-strain mélange belt containing many major linear fault strands. These fault strands, topographically expressed as distinctive linear gullies, contain localized bands of fault gouge and discrete faults exhibiting numerous principal slip surfaces. We argue that these rocks represent a **paleomegathrust interface hosted in the sediments**, shedding light on megathrust earthquake processes at clastic sediment rich subduction zones like Cascadia. The fault zone has many simultaneously active fault strands comprising a **webbed fault structure that itself is the décollement**.
